<html><body>Adventurers' Guide:<br>
You had a long journey, hadn't you? I'm sure you are tired.<br>
I help everybody who fights evil!<br>
Thanks to the warriors such as yourself, our villagers could survive despite of all the darkness that had surrounded us.<br>
If you have unnecessary things that can be donated, I will give you high level buffs in exchange.<br>
