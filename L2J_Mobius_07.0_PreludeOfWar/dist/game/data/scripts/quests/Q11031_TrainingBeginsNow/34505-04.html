That's it! I will tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font>. These items contain the power of souls. When you use <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots, your weapon starts shining and deals serious damage</font>. They are very important items that are ncredibly useful when attacking with standard weapons.<br>
If you have Soulshot in your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font>, they <font color="LEVEL">will automatically move to the shortcut slot and activate</font>. Click the slot with the right mouse button If you decide not use them.<br>
There also exist <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font>, they <font color="LEVEL"> increase the power of magic</font>. If you want your magic spells to be highly effective, use Spiritshots.<br>
Okay, consider Soulshots covered. Now you'll need <font color="LEVEL">buffs</font>... Have you heard of them?<br>
