You haven't finished the test. In order to reach another level, you must pass the test.<br>
You must overcome not just the limit of the power you were born with, but also the limit of the new power you obtained.<br>
Make sure you're <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 104</font>. Then, go find <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad Temple</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Dion</font>.<br><br><br>
