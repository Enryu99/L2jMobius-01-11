I need some <font color="LEVEL">Reinforced Iron Piece</font>. It's made by applying magic to Iron Ore. There aren't any Mystics around, so we'll have to improvise... Creatures known as <font color="LEVEL">Lost Steel Golem</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Frost Steel Golem</font> can be found in Frozen Labyrinth. Peel off some of its scrap and bring it to me! I'll need about <font color="LEVEL">five</font> pieces. These golems are quite durable, and won't peel away easily. Give it all you've got!
