Kill <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Scouts, Skeleton Archers, and Skeleton Warriors</font>. When you're done, go to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Zenath</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>.<br>
It seems like it's even worse for her there. I will teleport you to the Skeletons, so you can proceed to the mission right away.<br>
By the way, haven't you used <font color="LEVEL">automatic hunting</font> yet? I strongly recommend that you do. You can see the details in the Help menu.<br>
