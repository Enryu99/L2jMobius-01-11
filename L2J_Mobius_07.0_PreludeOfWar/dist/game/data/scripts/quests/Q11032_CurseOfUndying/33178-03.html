All we can do here is to help the dead to go to their last home. It is necessary to kill <font color="LEVEL">Nasty Zombies and Nasty Zombie Lords.</font><br>

By the way, it will be easier to complete the mission if you use <font color="LEVEL">Use Supplies Automatically</font> function. Just try it out and you'll see.<br>
