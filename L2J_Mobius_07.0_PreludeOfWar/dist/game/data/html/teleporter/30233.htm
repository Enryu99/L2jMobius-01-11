Well hello there! Don't mind me, I'm just standing around just in case you're bleeding out from a monster bite and need to be teleported to safety. Or miss home terribly. Or need to go help a dying friend. Or really miss seeing the sea.<br>
That said, do you need to get somewhere?<br>
(Characters whose <font color="LEVEL">main class level is 1-99</font> can teleport for free.)<br>
