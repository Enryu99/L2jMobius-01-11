The king of Aden Amadeo Cadmus is still very young, but he's already proven to be a great leader. The exploration of the Ruins of the Giants was his idea. He is easy on the eyes and very smart to boot.<br>
Flowing blonde hair... Gorgeous face... Sometimes I thinks that he's an Elf. Meanwhile the kind of Elmore Astair looks like a highway robber... I'm so happy that I'm a citizen of Aden!<br>
