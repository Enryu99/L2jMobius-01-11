Soulshots are concentrated spirit powers, crafted by the most skilled Dwarvern Artisans. When applied to weapons, they add a significant amount of damage, you know!<br>
Soulshots will be activated automatically as long as you have a weapon of the same grade equipped. You can switch this off or on by right-clicking on the soulshot icon on the upper right corner of the shortcut bar.
