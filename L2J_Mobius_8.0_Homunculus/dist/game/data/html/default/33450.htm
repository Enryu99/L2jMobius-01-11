I've heard that these ruins used to be a garden of the ancient king of Giants. According to legend, he was so jealous of his wife, that he locked the poor thing in a labyrinth. She was finally saved by Gran Kain.<br>
Posessive husband... Scatterbrained Gran Kain... Yeah, this queen sure was unlucky... Hm...<br>
