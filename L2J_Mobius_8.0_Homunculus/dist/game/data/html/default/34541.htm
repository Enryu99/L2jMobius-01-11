Welcome! My name is Karinia. I help adventures to travel to instance zones. Every adventurer of Lv. 100 and highter can enter the Kastia's Labyrinth. But there's one requirement. If you have defeated the last boss on any of three difficulty levels, you can't enter the Kastia's Labyrinth again until the next day. Remember it.<br>
