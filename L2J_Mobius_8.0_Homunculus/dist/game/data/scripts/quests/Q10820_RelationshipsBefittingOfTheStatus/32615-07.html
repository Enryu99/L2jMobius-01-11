Well, if you got that, take the materials I give you and try making one.<br>
If you need more <font color="LEVEL">Recipe: Citrine Pendant</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Citrine Pendant Fragments</font> let me know. You'll have to get the other materials, though.<br>
Here, take them.<br>
You can craft a Citrine Pendant, or you can pay the Black Marketeer of Mammon to craft it.
