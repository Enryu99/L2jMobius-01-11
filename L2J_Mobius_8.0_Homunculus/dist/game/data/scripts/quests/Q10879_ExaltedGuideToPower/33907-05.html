I'll tell you about the fifth test.<br>
First, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">Lv.105</font> to prove that you're qualified to be Guide of Power. You must also pass the tests of the following people and receive their certificates.<br>
The testers include <font color="LEVEL">Master Cyphona</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Quartermaster Dinford</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Blackbird Campsite</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Owner Settlen</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Underground Gainak Mystic Tavern</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Admiral Keucereus</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Keucereus Alliance Base</font>.<br><br><br>
Only they know what they'll test you on, so go talk to them. If you forget who you must go to, refer to the guide I'll be giving you.
