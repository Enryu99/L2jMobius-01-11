I'll tell you about the fourth test.<br>
First, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 104</font> to prove you are qualified to advance to the new stage. You must also pass the tests of the following people and receive their certificates.<br>
Your testers include <font color="LEVEL">Commando Captain Sporcha</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hellbound Refugee Camp</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Giant Tracker Leader Krenaht</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Cave</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Guild Leader Santiago</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Guild President Arcturus</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Village</font>.<br><br><br>
Only they know what they'll test you on, so go talk to them. If you forget who you must go to, refer to the guide I'll be giving you.
