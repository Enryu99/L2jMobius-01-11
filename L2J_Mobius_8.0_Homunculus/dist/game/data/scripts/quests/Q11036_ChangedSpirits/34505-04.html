The Windy Hill has been the domain of spirits called the Sobbing Wind, the Whispering Wind and the Giggling Wind. They, however, have changed quite drastically lately.<br>
If instead of them you find creatures called <font color="LEVEL">Sobbing Windra, Whispering Windra and Giggling Windra</font> destroy them without second thought.<br>
After you're done report to Researcher Pio.<br>
I Will teleport you right to the Windy Hill.<br>
