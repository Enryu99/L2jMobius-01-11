Hmm... Does everyone around here knows what I'm working on?! Well, okay then. I'm really glad that you offered to help me. You see, I want to sew a shirt that can be worn under Heavy Armor. I was going to use Manticore Skin as fabrics and embroider a beautiful pattern on it with strong as steel <font color="LEVEL">Trisalim Silk</font>. But there is one problem. During the recent hurricane some raindrops go into my <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font>, and it lost it's magical power! And I need <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font> to color Trisalim Silk. Then there's also Roxxy who promised to make yarn for me, but she didn't have enough thread...<br>
Adventurers haven't passed trough here for so long that I was beginning to worry. You see, I really need <font color="LEVEL">Trisalim Silk</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font>. Can I count on you for help?<br>
