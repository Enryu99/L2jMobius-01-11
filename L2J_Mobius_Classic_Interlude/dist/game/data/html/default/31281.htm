Dear traveler from a faraway country! May the peace of the lake and blessings of light be with you always...<br>
As you can see, the temple of this village also serves as the Warrior guild. Our society reveres military power as much as we venerate religion.<br>
But military power can be a two-edged sword. Although necessary for survival, always remember that the sword that saves your life today may cut you down tomorrow!<br>
