You should always choose your purchases carefully! Just because something sparkles doesn't make it a diamond! This is especially true when it comes to accessories! Never judge an item's quality by its outward appearance!<br>
The same is true about people. Do you see the Dwarf named Candice over there? She may look like a child, but she's actually older than I am!<br>
