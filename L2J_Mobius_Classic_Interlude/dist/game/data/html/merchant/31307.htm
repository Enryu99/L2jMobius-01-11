A dye's power is like a devil's blessing! While it gives you strong power, it takes away another power from you! In order to become more powerful, you must make a sacrifice, especially for an indispensable item!<br>
I personally guarantee the quality of the dyes sold here! I'm the most trusted dye dealer in the entire kingdom!<br>
