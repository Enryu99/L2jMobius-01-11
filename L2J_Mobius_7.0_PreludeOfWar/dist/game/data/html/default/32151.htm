For Orcs! Greetings, Warrior! I know that even air of this foreign state seems unfamiliar to you. But what can we do? That's what the world is.<br>
At least Kamael feels free to communicate in here. People like Marcela Zerstorer have the same point of view on the weapon as we are, so if you are staying here for a while, I recommend you to meet her.<br>
I see you are eager to go to the journey. If that so you better concentrate on the continent, not this tiny isle. There must be powerful enemies, threats and endless skills to gain! You unlikely find it here!<br>
