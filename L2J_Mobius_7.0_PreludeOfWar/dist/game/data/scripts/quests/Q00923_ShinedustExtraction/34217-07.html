Good. Let me explain the details. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">upper level of Giant's Cave</font>, defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Giant Soldier, Lesser Giant Warrior, Lesser Giant Wizard, Recovering Lesser Giant Warrior, Recovering Lesser Giant Wizard, Halisha's Henchman Marka, Halisha's Henchman Schlien, Halisha's Henchman Berimah, Demons Foreman Naia Bathus, Demons Foreman Naia Carcass, Demons Foreman Naia Kshana and Demons Foreman Naia Lucas</font>, and put them to rest.<br>
As evidence, please bring back <font color="LEVEL">200 Shinedust's</font>. It should be manageable.
