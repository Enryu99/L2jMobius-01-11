<html><body>Fishing Guild Leader Santiago:<br>
There are some poor people in this area. Gather <font color="LEVEL">50 Special Fish Stews</font> to feed them.<br>
To make 1 Special Fish Stew, you need <font color="LEVEL">1 Powerful Fish</font> and <font color="LEVEL">1 Magic Spice</font>. Once you get them, ask me and I'll exchange them immediately. You can gather the igredients yourself or buy them.<br>
I'd also like to teach them how to fish, but I don't have enough materials for fishing rods. Please gather <font color="LEVEL">80 Gemstones (R-Grade)</font> for me. That's your mission.
