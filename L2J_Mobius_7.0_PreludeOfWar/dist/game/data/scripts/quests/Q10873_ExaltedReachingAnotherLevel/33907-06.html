You haven't finished all the tests. In order to reach another level, you must pass all the tests.<br>
You must overcome not just the limit of the power you were born with, but also the limit of the new power you obtained.<br>
Make sure you're <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 104</font>. Then, go find <font color="LEVEL">Commando Captain Sporcha</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hellbound Refugee Camp</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Giant Tracker Leader Krenaht</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Cave</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Guild Leader Santiago</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Guild President Arcturus</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Village</font>, and pass the tests they give you.<br><br><br>
It's best that you hear about the tests from them. Remember to bring back their certificates.
