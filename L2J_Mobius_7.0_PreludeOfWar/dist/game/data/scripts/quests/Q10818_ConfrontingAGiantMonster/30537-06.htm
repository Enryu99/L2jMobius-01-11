Defeat the monsters that are threatening the safety of this world. I'll tell you which ones to defeat.<br>
First, you must defeat <font color="LEVEL">Istina, Octavis, Tauti and Ekimus</font> in an <font color="LEVEL">Epic Battle</font>. You must also defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Earth Wyrm Trasken</font>, and bring a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Soul Stone</font>.<br><br>
However, defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken is difficult. That's why I have another method. Would like to hear it?<br>

Or you can skip all this and hunt some easier monsters.<br>
