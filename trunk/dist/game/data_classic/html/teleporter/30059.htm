Taking a walk and taking in the sights is always good for you, but sometimes you just don't have the time, you know? I can help you if you want to go somewhere through the gate of time and space.<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">main class</font> is <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 40</font> or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
