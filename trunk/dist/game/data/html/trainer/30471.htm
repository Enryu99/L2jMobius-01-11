Nice to meet you, young traveler. I'm Rupio of the Black Anvil Guild and this pest is my little brother Pushkin. Hahaha!<br>
Our equipment just arrived this morning, so we're just getting set up. Our delivery somehow ended up in Heine... go figure. Wish I'd been with them. I've always wanted to visit Heine. Oh well. Anyway, enough about us. What can we do for you?<br>
