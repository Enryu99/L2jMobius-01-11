<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Lunin:<br>
After 50 years working as a warehouse keeper, I've discovered the truth: money comes and goes. For instance, the van Holter family controlled Rune's commercial rights until last year, but now it's run by the Benandati Cartel.<br>
Of course, it's helpful to know these kind of things if you want to run a business in a dangerous place like this one...<br>
