<html><body>High Prefect Shaka:<br>
My Orc comrade! Are you ready to be reborn in blood and fire as a true warrior of our kind? Schuttgart Territory is necessary if our race is to regain our former glory.<br>
How long must we suffer the disdain of those puny Dwarves and moon-faced Elves? Young Orc! Schuttgart may well become a key strategic position for the warriors of the Elmorean kingdom. If we Orcs unite, it will be a trivial matter to occupy this defenseless place. Stoke up your smoldering vengeance! The time to strike swift and hard will soon be at hand.<br>
