Grand Master Aldenia:<br>
Welcome to the Human Embassy. I am the ambassador, Grand Master Aldenia.<br>
Following the summit in Giran, it was agreed that each race would send a representative here to facilitate cooperation in the fight against the forces of evil. I am sorry to say, however, that we Humans are often distracted by internal squabbles over territory, religion and power. Forging an alliance with other races can be very difficult.<br>
Especially when some meddlers like the High Priest at Einhasad over there walk around like they are ambassadors as well... Short-sighted buffoon, promoting the interests of certain temples only... Aye... I'm sorry; please pay no attention to complaints -- I'm simply tired.<br>
How may I help you?<br>
