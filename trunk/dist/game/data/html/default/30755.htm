<html><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
I am Theodric, the watchful eye over Antharas...<br>
My heavenly mandate is to observe every action of Antharas, creation of the cursed goddess Shilen, to make sure that it does not awaken from its deep sleep. I have sacrificed my soul to darkness and have become an immortal undead in order to carry out this holy mission.<br>
Even if you enter this cave, you cannot reach Antharas' nest. The entrance has been thihtly shut by the seal guardians. In order to enter, you must use a <font color="LEVEL">Portal Stone</font> to activate the <font color="LEVEL">Heart of Warding</font>...<br>
