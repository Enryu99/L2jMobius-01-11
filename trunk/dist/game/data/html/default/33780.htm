I am Hesed! Hesed of the Black Anvil Guild, the proud nurturer of renowned artisans and warsmiths.I came to the Isle of Souls on a very important mission.<br>
Say, have you ridden a ship before? My gods, the swaying! Didn't you see any big ships on your way? Yes, that's the very one. No one told me such a big could sway so much! I miss home and all, but just thinking of getting back on that ship makes me ill.<br>
