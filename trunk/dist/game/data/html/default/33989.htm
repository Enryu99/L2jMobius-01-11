<html><body>Remembrance Tower:<br>
On the day Faeron passed into the Material Realm, we were attacked by monsters of the Material Realm.<br>
We were not prepared for such a sudden attack and suffered a great loss of life.<br>
In remembrance of those poor lives we could not protect, this tower is hereby erected.<br>
