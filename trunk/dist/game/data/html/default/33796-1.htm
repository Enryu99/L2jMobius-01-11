Did you see towering red rocks protruding from the ground on your way here? We managed to seal some of them with help from Dwarves, but many more remain unsealed. Some of them even appear and disappear repeatedly! They're called "Spicula Clone Generator Yin", and are proof that Nomil's defenses have spread to these lands. <font color="LEVEL">Nomil's Cave</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Nomil's Garden</font> where <font color="LEVEL">Spicula Clone Generator Boz</font> resides are most affected by the defense system. it is said that Boz creates more Spiculas when it's attacked or recognizes intruders.<br>
