If you're ready, I'll start my story... I'll tell you about what happened in Magmeld long ago. In the era of the Giants this place was a haven for the heroes chosen by Einhasad. Grand Cain against her will opened the way to Magmeld heroes of other races, worshiped other gods. Einhasad also did not want to make this place came out of her control. She handed her fourth daughter <font color="LEVEL">Pauline</font> sword of light and sentenced her to sharpen them up in prison. Pauline met her order, imprisoning everyone who was wicked Einhasad in <font color="LEVEL">Exile Prison of Darkness,</font> woven from the starlight.<br>
