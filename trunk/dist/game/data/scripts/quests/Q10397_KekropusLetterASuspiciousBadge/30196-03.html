According to our latest report, <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Badges</font> were found on monsters out there. They may have something to do with the monsters' increased ferocity.<br>
For more information, go talk to <font color="LEVEL">Andy the Patrol</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. Good luck then.<br>
To reach the Sea of Spores, use this <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape: Sea of Spores</font>, or ask a Gatekeeper for help.
