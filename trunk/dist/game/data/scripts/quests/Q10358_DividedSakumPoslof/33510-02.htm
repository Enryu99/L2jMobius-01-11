<html><body>Guard Lef:<br>
The best way to describe it is <font color="LEVEL">Poslof</font> is <font color="LEVEL">a portion</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font> that is able to exist on its own. Bad news is that it sin't just one of them... we are receiving reports from guards in other locations of multiple Poslof sightings.<br>
Kind of bad day to find out that your only problem just turned into several problems.<br>
I would send you out to defeat Poslof, but I'm not sure where it is at the moment. I don't suppose you would be interested in de-raging the rampaging creatures in the area until I can find out where Poslof is?<br>
