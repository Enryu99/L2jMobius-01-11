You don't? Then why don't you try it with this Soulshot I have for you? 
Open your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font> and check for <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font>.<br>
Also, remember that the <font color="LEVEL">grades of the weapon and the Soulshot have to be the same</font>.<br>
Then, check if the Soulshot in the Automatic Soulshot window is activated.<br>
You can activate/deactivate by clicking on the icon.<br>
It will be very handy from now on when you fight.<br>
Tell me when you have that done.
