Theodore sent you here?<br>
He told me he sent someone special. He said I should ask the person to <font color="LEVEL">get rid of Ancient Ghosts</font>. If that person ever arrived.<br>
You probably don't remember, probably think of Harnak as a mere ghost who couldn't harm a fly. But in the past... well.<br>
Harnak was such a mad, obsessive giant he put his wife in a labyrinth where she died. His obsessive lunacy pervades the Harnak Underground Ruins. His followers wander as Ancient Ghosts and abnormally powerful his influence. You must be not only physically, but also mentally prepared.<br>
