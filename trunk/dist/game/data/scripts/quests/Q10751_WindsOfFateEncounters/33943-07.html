In Telesha's body? I knew it. There must be something. The Wind Spirit Realm's object being found in the Material Realm and all. I will take this to the Queen for you.<br1>
Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would never have known about her death.<br>
This tells me that you're ready for your 1st Liberation.<br>
