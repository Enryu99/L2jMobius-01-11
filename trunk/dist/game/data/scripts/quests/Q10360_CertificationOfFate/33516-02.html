What? Master? Ahh... You must be dispatched as a special supporter in order to catch Sakum. It seems like your abilities are sufficient -- after all you caught Kanilov!<br>
But, before you catch Sakum... I want you to defeat Sakum's other self, Poslof. The bio-energy, which is absorbed by poslof, will affect Sakum if it is absorbed by him instead. We must kill Poslof first!<br>
