As, I see. I am a rune scholar who helps out the Giant's minions. From what they sent over, I've found something called <font color=LEVEL> Inverted Ewaz</font>, an ancient text which can harness the power of Gaints.<br>
I'm not sure, but I suspect this was some kind of spell to suppress the Giants' powers. I'd like to find out more.... will you help me?<br>
