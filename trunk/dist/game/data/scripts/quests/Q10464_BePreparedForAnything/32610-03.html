<html><body>Weaver Olf Kanore:<br>
A <font color="LEVEL">belt</font> starts out pretty ordinary, like the other basic armor pieces. However, if you have a <font color="LEVEL">magic pin</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">magic pouch</font>, a good weaver like me can work wonders. You can add so many features to it!<br>
I suggest you try it yourself. I think getting hands-on experience will help you learn faster.<br>
If you're ready, I'll give you some materials so you can get started right away.<br>
