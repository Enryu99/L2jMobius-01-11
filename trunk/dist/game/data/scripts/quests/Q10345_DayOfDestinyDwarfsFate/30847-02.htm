<html><body>Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
I have been given a divine revelation of a new destiny for all who are qualified to represent the Blacksmith Guild. I judge you to be qualified in all aspects.<br>
The Blacksmith Guild is in a dire situation, and we need more candidates like you if we are to redeem ourselves for following the Goddess of Destruction. If you are ready to receive new powers and restore honor to our clan, accept this mission.<br>
