I am actually working on an antidote for the epidemic along with several Dark Elves. But I'm not a scholar or a magician, so there aren't that many things I can do. All I can do is collect research ingredients from nearby monsters to help with the research.<br>
But I'm not a warrior, so that's why I must ask adventurers like you for help.<br>
