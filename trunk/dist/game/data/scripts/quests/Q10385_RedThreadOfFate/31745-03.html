Thank you. How do you like lake's waters? The sparkle under sunlight is truly breathtaking. I wonder if the <font color="LEVEL">Brightest Light</font> held by <font color="LEVEL">Nerupa</font> looks something like this.
 I heard that Nerupa has left the Mother Tree to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Arms of Timiniel</font> in Magmeid. Which makes sense, as Magmeid is the only place where the Red Moon does not rise.<br>
 "But...he must also miss his old home, right?"<br>
