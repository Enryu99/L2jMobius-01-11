Huh? You completed a task? That's great, but why are you telling me about it? <br>
I'm a Dwarf, not of your race. I've run across folk who can't tell an Elf from a Kamael, but I rarely run into problems with people thinking Dwarfs are anything but Dwarfs. We do have fairly distinct characteristics. You may want to consider getting an eye exam. Or, perhaps you got hit in the think box one too many times in the last battle? Hmm? A little R and R might be called for.
