A task? You want a task? Hmm. Well, all right. You know the island underwent huge changes after the giants' island of sky crashed down? The landscape changed, new types of plants sprouted, new varieties of monsters appeared.<br>
That's the task. The monsters. They're a hazard. We haven't yet finished researching the Ruins of Ye Sagira, and with the distraction of constant monster attacks, we're not likely to any time soon. Go join the research team. Protect them.<br>
Get rid of those blasted monsters and in turn, I'll help you with your <font color="LEVEL">class transfer</font>. What do you think? Interested?<br>
