They shoved up a few weeks ago, a group & humans acting secretive and weird. I followed them into the Labyrinth and spied on them a bit, long enough to see that they had a large Evil Fragment.<br>
There was one, who seemed to be the leader, doing some kind & magical ritual on the fragment. Probably trying to hatch it. Can you even imagine what will happen if they manage that? The whole place might collapse again. This is why I sent to town for help, and it seems like you're the one they dispatched. So, what do you say? Will you help me?<br>
