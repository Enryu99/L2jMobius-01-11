Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up there! This place is dangerous--someone died in here recently. We can't let just anyone go waltzing in and out. Ahh... You're the ranger dispatched from the town. You can go on your way, but you'll want to know a couple & things first.<br>
I haven't been able to investigate, because I'm recovering from an injury, but there've been rumors or strangers going in and out or the underground area, and also of suspicious intruders in the Museum. Are these things linked?<br>
