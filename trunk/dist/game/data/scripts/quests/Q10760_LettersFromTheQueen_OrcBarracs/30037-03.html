Near Windy Hill, there are Orc Barracs. It's where the Turek Orcs have settled.<br>
But the Orcs have been behaving strangely lately.<br>
I'm worried if they intend to ivade this village using the odd happenings on Windy Hill. If that happens, it will catastrophic.<br>
First go to <font color="LEVEL">Orc Barracs</font> and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Piotur</font>. He will tell you what you need to know.<br>
