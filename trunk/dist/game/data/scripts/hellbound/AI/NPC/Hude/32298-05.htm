Oh, look who's here! I've got a big opportunity this time. If you catch the Chimeras in the Battered Lands with the Magic Bottle, you can obtain a unique item. Bring me 56 Life Forces and 14 Contained Life Forces. Then we will accept you as our friend. Before you go, take a look at the special item that we use.<br>
