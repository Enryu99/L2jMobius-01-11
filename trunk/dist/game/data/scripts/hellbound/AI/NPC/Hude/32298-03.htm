Ah, it's you! I was hoping it was Falk... I haven't heard from him for over a week. If you happen to see him, please tell him that I'm looking for him. I know that he went looking for Scorpion Poison Stingers, which are very useful as medicine...<br>
Say, perhaps you would be wiling to go and get me 60 Scorpion Poison Stingers and 30 Marks of Betrayal? If you do, I will give you a voucher so you can trade with me.<br>
