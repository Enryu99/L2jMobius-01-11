You must be the one my lord has mentioned. There is no time to waste. Great darkness surrounds us all; we must find the <font color="LEVEL">6th seal</font> and stop <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font> as soon as possible.<br>
I was following leads on the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> and found out that they call the 6th seal "Punishment." Worse, they've already located it.<br>
Fortunately, they don't know how to undo the seal, but it's only a matter of time. We must stop them! Or else...<br>
It's too terrible to contemplate. Will you help?<br>
