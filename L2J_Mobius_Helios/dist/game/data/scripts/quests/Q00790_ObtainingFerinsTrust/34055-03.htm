We know of a way to defeat those spirits, at least temporarily. <br>
I'll make sure to reward you if you do this mission. And each time you complete the mission, I'll give you an item that will prove our trust.<br>
You can prove the level of trust between us. The higher the level, the better the rewards. Also, I'll be able to give you top secret missions. However, these marks do disappear with time, so in order to keep our trust, you must continue doing missions from time to time.<br>
