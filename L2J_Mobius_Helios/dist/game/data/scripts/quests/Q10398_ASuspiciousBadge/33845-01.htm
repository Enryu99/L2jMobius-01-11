Several large battles raged between elves and human on the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. Back when they fought for the continent. It wasn't long all the magical energy birthed the spores, and well... you can tell from the name. The wizards at the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font> created a force field to prevent the spores from spreading further, as well as to keep the monsters inside. But lately the monsters have been acting very suspicious. I'm worried that if we don't do anything, they might take down the forcefield and plunge this whole area into chaos.<br>
