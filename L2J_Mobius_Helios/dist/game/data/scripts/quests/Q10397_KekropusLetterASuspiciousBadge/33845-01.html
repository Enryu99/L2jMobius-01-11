Here in the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>, we're dependent upon a force field built by the Ivory Tower wizards. The force field prevents the spores from expanding outward and keeps monsters inside at the same time. But lately the monsters have been acting suspicious. I'm worried that if we don't do anything, they might take down the forcefield and plunge this whole area into chaos.<br>
