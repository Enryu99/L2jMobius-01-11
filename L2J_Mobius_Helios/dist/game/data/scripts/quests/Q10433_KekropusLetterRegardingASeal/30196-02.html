<html><body>Captain Mouen:<br>
So you're the one our lord mentioned. Situations are dire, and darkness spreads. We must find the <font color="LEVEL">6th Seal</font> and stop <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font> as soon as possible.<br>
I was tracking down leads on <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> and found out that they call the 6th seal "Vengeance." Worse, they've already located it.<br>
Fortunately they don't know how to remove the seal, but it won't be long before they figure it out. We must do something to stop them. If not, the world would...<br>
It's too terrible to contemplate. Can you help?<br>
