<tr><td>Ages ago, the seven tribes of the Orc race</tr></td> 
<tr><td>ruled the world. However, 2,000 years ago, we</tr></td> 
<tr><td>fought for control with the treacherous Elves</tr></td> 
<tr><td>and went to war. Of course, our strength far</tr></td> 
<tr><td>surpassed any other single race's, but the</tr></td> 
<tr><td>Elves drew the scheming Humans to their side</tr></td> 
<tr><td>and, in the end, we were defeated and driven</tr></td> 
<tr><td>out. But the haughty Elves were betrayed by</tr></td> 
<tr><td>the Humans and chased deep into the forest.</tr></td> 
<tr><td>You may be assured, they dug their own grave.</tr></td>
<br> 
<tr><td>After that defeat, we constructed our new</tr></td> 
<tr><td>home, here in the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font>, which</tr></td> 
<tr><td>used to be the castle grounds of Paagrio. We</tr></td> 
<tr><td>are diligently preparing for the time when the</tr></td> 
<tr><td>Orcs will again flourish. But in the meantime,</tr></td>
<tr><td>one of the seven tribes, the Lagra Tribe,</tr></td>
<tr><td>betrayed the others and stained our honour by</tr></td>
<tr><td>leaving us. The traitors must not be forgiven!</tr></td>
<tr><td>They are a disgraceful clan that has trampled</tr></td>
<tr><td>our dignity into the dust. They do not deserve</tr></td>
<tr><td>to be called Orcs.</tr></td>
