We don't have a clear solution just yet. For now, we've asked for help here and there in order to investigate the current situation in Dragon Valley. We are being helped by the Ertheia, and have been engaged continously in research. We don't have anything concrete yet. However, according to the information we have gained so far, the strange goings on in Dragon Valley don't appear to be due to just the recent changes in the dimensions. That's why we've called on the help of others.<br>
