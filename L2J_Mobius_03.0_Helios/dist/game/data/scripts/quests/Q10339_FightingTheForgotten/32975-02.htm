You've gained a new power. That means you survived the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira</font>. No, more than survived. You even fought off <font color="LEVEL">Harnak's Wraith</font>.<br>
You know, Harnak was once the ruler of the Giant Kingdom. Even as a wraith, he still holds considerable power. If you were strong enough to defeat him, you could probably handle <font color="LEVEL">Harnak Underground Ruins</font> as well. Maybe.<br>
