All right. We know that the Suspicious Badges are the Giants' Alphabet, and you stopped monsters from collecting them, so we're good for now. But it makes you wonder, doesn't it? What if someone is actually behind all this? I think I'll stay here to keep an eye on things, just in case.<br>
Thanks for all your help. If you ever get a chance, go see my teacher <font color="LEVEL">Paterson</font>. He'll like you a lot, I'm sure. Haha!
