<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
Traveler, I am working on a secret mission for King Astair of Elmore. However, the majority of our soldiers are currently fighting against Shilen, the Goddess of Destruction. I have been authorized to recruit willing travelers as mercenaries.<br>
If you meet the following requirements, would you assist with my mission? If you agree, I'll tell you details about the mission.<br>
The requirements for a mercenary are...<br>
First, you must be fearless against all enemies.<br>
Second, you must be willing to fight on behalf of the King.<br>
Third, you must have the courage to face multiple enemies alone.<br>
Well? Will you help me?<br>
