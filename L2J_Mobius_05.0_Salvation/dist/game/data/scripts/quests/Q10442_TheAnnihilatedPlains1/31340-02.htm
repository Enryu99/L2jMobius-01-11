Good. You're far braver than most adventurers. Have you heard of the place called the <font color="LEVEL">Land of Chaos</font> near the Orc Village?<br>
It used to be a peaceful plain, but on the orders of <font color="LEVEL">Devil Triol, one of the 4 most powerful devils</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Corrupt Shaman Krogel</font> started his movement. Krogel ended up settling in the Land of Chaos near the Orc Village.<br>
As soon as he settled there, the baron from Hell lured in nearby creatures and built a mountain of dead bodies. In the process, the refugees who were fleeing the Orc Village fell victim to him as well.<br>
As if the numerous dead bodies of such creatures and nearby monsters wasn't bad enough, Chimera monsters sewn together from dead bodies have started appearing in the Land of Chaos.<br>
