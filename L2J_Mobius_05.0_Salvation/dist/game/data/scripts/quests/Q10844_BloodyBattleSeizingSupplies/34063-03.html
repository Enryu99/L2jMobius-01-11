It's not that difficult. You must have seen the <font color="LEVEL">supply boxes</font> laying around. They started getting supplies regularly, but they are still not organized.<br>
Please open those <font color="LEVEL">supply boxes</font> and get me the <font color="LEVEL">supplies</font>. Don't just open any box though. There are some <font color="LEVEL">traps</font> that could make it very dangerous.<br>
 Oh, and one more thing! If you <font color="LEVEL">defeat</font> the <font color="LEVEL">Quartermasters</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">soldiers will be affected</font>, making it easier to steal their supplies.
