# ----------------------------
#  Config BackLog
# ----------------------------
# Maximum length of request.
# The maximum length for incoming requests (connection request).
# Maximum number of requests, after which the requests
# Will not be accepted.
# The default is 50
# Must be equal to the estimated number of players.
# Example: Players in the game 1000 +, NetworkBackLog = 1000 
# NetworkBackLog = 50

# ----------------
#  Set TOS
# ----------------
# Set the traffic going to a particular socket.
# Can be ignored JAVA-machine.
# Range: 0 <= tc <= 255 or a ban happens.
# Note:
# To TCP4 should be set high priority and should be RFC 1349.
# You can also create a type priorities bit, example:
# IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
# IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
# IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
# IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)
# The lowest bit is ignored (0).
# Set bits in the priority may cause the collapse of the server.
# depends on the service and platform.
# Note:
# Applications can not change GameServer after connecting.
# To TCP6 value can be found in the header sin6_flowinfo.
# NetworkIpTOS = 0

#  Set a timeout
# ------------------------

# Zero timeout is defined as an infinite timeout.
