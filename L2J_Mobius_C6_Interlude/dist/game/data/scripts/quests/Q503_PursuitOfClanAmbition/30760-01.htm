The power of the royals has been slowly eroding for years. The bloody peasants' uprising of a few years ago in Dion is the proof. From this chaos several small cells within the country are gaining strength in preparation for grasping a large share of the kingdom for themselves.<BR>Our kingdom needs young, energetic lords like you to lead it into the future. Once your clan distinguishes itself further, I will join forces with you and lend you my support.<BR>
(Only a level 4 clan leader can undertake this quest.)
