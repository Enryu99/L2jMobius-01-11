Greetings!  Your reputation precedes you.  Your clan is quite powerful, eh? And you are headed to Dragon Valley...? I've got a favor to ask you. Could you possibly try to find my younger brother? He is a bounty hunter who has fallen in with a bad crowd known as the <FONT color="LEVEL">Magpie Brothers</FONT>. It is said that they are searching for something in Dragon Valley at the behest of some  Human royalty... Something is not right about this...
