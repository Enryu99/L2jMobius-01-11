Then you'll need to prepare your fishing tools. You'll need <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Rod</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Bait</font>. You can only fish if you have them.<br>
You can receive the Normal Bait from me, but if you want to catch more expensive fish, I recommend you use the Special Bait. I have never seen Special Bait, but I heard that you can get it from the boxes you get from fishing.<br>
You can also purchase Fishing Rods from me, but for now, I will lend one to you for practice. If you already have it, feel free to use it. So, what do you think? Nothing difficult, hmm?<br>
