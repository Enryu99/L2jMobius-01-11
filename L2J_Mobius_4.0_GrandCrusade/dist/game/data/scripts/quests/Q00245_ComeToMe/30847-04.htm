I'm trying to make a ring. Or a necklace, but I think a ring would be the best place to start. Anyway, in order to make it I'll need some simple ingredients.<br>
It shouldn't be too much of a challenge for you to collect what I need. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Swamp</font>, defeat <font color="LEVEL">Lava Wyrms and Swamp Predators</font>, and bring me back <font color="LEVEL">15 Blazing Ashes</font>. Once you get those, we can hit up your sponsor for the rest of ingredients I need.
