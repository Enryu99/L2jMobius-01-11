Hey, you! You haven't left yet? Are you too scared to go to the Land of Chaos?<br>
When you get to the <font color="LEVEL">Land of Chaos</font>, you will see <font color="LEVEL">Refugee Corpses</font>. Find a <font color="LEVEL">Refugee's Necklace</font> and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Rune Backup Trooper Falk</font>.<br>
Ah! You can go to the Land of Chaos through the Sayune next to me.
