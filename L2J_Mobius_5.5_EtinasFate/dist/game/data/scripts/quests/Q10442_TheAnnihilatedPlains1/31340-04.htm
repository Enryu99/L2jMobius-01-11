<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
Your courage is commendable. I'll be counting on you.<br>
I've already dispatched my own soldiers, Falk and Parajan, to Gainak and the Land of Chaos respectively.<br>
Go meet <font color="LEVEL">Flame Patrol Vice Captain Tuska</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Gainak of the Schuttgart territory</font>. He will tell you how to get to the Land of Chaos and what to do in more detail.<br>
Keep in mind that you can go to Gainak through the <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper in the Town of Rune</font>.
