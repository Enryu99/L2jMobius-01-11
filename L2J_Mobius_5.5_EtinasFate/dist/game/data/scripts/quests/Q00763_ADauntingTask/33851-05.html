Oh boy... I lost you, didn't I? Listen closely this time.<br>
Kill every monster you see at the <font color="LEVEL">Wall of Argos</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">50</font> <font color="LEVEL">Evil Eyes of Darkness</font>, and I'll give you a reward. And there's something extra in it for you for every <font color="LEVEL">Powerful Dark Malice</font> you bring.
