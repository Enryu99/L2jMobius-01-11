So you want to take the scepter, don't you?<br>
I'm a blacksmith, and I like swords better, but if you use magic, a scepter is the right choice.<br>
Have you heard how a recent storm destroyed so many buildings? I am very concerned about the damage that the local temple has suffered. Harrys began reconstruction, but he needs more workers. Could you help him, please?<br>
