I don't really know the details yet. All I've heard is that <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Badges</font> were found on monsters, and I assume they're what's making the monsters so violent. There's a scholar staying here in the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font> to investigate the badges.<br>
I appreciate you coming all the way out here. Hopefully you can get to the bottom of this.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can develop yourself through quests and hunting at the hunting ground of the Sea of Spores. You can get the next item, Kekropus' Letter, at Lv. 58.</font>
