That place... has already turned into a place of immortality...<br>
Kakai, the Lord of Flame, asked King Astair of Elmore for reinforcements and King Astair ordered me to get rid of monsters in the <font color="LEVEL">Land of Chaos</font>.<br>
I've already fought through the area with 5 to 6 soldiers. It's a cruel, surreal land to say the least.<br>
The Land of Chaos morphed into a hellish place where Chimera monsters are born and have settled. We have to get rid of them, but there were too many for us to stop. If they spread to nearby areas, this will only get worse.<br>
Have I scared you off? Or will you help us?<br>
