Oh!<br>
The Labyrinth of Belis, a terrifying lair that's home to the largest of the monsters, is in <font color="LEVEL">Exploration Zone 5</font>. You'll find it at the end of the ruins, along with the ranger <font color="LEVEL">Sebion</font>. Ask him, and he'll let you enter the labyrinth.<br>
I'll send you to Exploration Zone 5, if you're ready?<br>
