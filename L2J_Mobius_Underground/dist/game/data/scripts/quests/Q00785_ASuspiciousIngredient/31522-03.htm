In the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>, kill <font color="LEVEL">Undead</font> and bring me their <font color="LEVEL">Monster Flesh</font> as proof. Also when you collect them, you may get your hands on <font color="LEVEL">Monster Blood</font>. That is harder to come by, so it's okay if you can't get them. If you have enough of them, I will give you additional rewards.<br>
