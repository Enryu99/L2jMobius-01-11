Badly? Sebion is an able mage, and should be able to tend to his own woumds, but... hmmm... I will make sure he is replaced.<br>
When Sebion returns, we should bring and protect Bloodhound as well. Thank you for the detailed report - I will pray that the Blessing of Darkness be with you for years to come.
