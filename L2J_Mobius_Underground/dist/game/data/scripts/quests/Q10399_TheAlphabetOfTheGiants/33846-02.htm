<html><body>Paterson's Disciple Bacon:<br>
You want to free me up to research the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Alphabet</font>. You know you do.<br>
That's why you're going to help out! The monsters here go out of their way to collect the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Alphabet</font>, like someone ordered them to do it. Instead of watching them get more violent, and leaving me with nothing to study, you can kill them and bring the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Alphabet</font> to me. Great, isn't it?<br>
