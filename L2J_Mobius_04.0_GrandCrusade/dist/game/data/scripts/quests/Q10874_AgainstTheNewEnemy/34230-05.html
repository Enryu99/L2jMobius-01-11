Listen carefully, I won't explain this again. Hunt monsters in <font color="LEVEL">Beleth's Magic Circle, the Desert Quarry, and the upper floor of the Giant's Cave</font> and collect 10.000 <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Qualification</font>. What do you say? It's quite hard, right? Hahahaha!!!<br><br><br>
Ah, after completing the mission, go to Leona Blackbird, not to me. She's the one who can give you a certificate.<br>
