Have you heard of the book entitled "Traces of Living Beings in Ancient Times?" While clearing out the library's underground warehouse one day, I discovered a very old, very worn-out book filled with snatches of some ancient language. Believe me when I tell you that my years of working here have made me pretty familiar with most of the ancient tongues, but this language is totally strange to me. I hope to be able to eventually translate it, but right now it has me completely stymied!<br>
In any event, I placed it on my shelf and, to my chagrin, eventually forgot about it. But recently I have heard that it may be a very valuable tome -- very valuable indeed!<br>
