First, you can't use the old Soul Crystals anymore. To bestow the new special abilities, you need the new Soul Crystals. You can get them by defeating boss or raid monsters. <br>
Well, it's better to try it. Here's a <font color="LEVEL">Practice StormBringer</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Practice Soul Crystal - Stage 1</font>. Use this Practice Soul Crystal to bestow a special option onto the weapon.<br>
You need <font color="LEVEL">177 Gemstones (C-grade)</font>, but for now, you should try out by purchasing them. I'll give you just as many as a reward after you succeed. If you want, you can try it on another weapon, but I advise you against it, since the Practice Soul Crystal isn't as powerful.
