Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Swamp</font> and catch <font color="LEVEL">Hames Orc Footsoldier, Hames Orc Sniper, Hames Orc Shaman, and Hames Orc Prefects</font>. Then, collect <font color="LEVEL">12 Crystals of Experience</font>. <font color="LEVEL">But... make sure that your sponsor is watching when you kill them, or you won't be able to find any Crystals of Experience.</font> There's some magical bonding mojo going on there. It makes for a great opportunity for team building. Have fun now!
