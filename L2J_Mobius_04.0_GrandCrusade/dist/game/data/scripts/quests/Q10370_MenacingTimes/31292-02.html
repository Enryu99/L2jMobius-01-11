Hmmm... this comes from the Aden Vanguard? Yes, I had my suspicions that Goddard may be in danger. There has been a lot of <font color="LEVEL">strange activities</font> in the Goddard territory. However, since Shilen has invaded our world that is somewhat of an understatement. There is something strange anywhere you look now.<br>
I hope you are up for more of a challenge than just delivering this message to us. Several of Goddard`s forces are out on missions and we are short on manpower here. We`re looking for anyone who can swim a sword or cast a spell.<br>
