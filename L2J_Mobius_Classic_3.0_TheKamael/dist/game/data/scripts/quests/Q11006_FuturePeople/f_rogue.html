<html><body>Class description - Rogue:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Rogues</font> are warriors who rely on agility and cunning, rather than strength and honor.<br>
In combat, they use Daggers and Bows, which allows them to effectively dispose of enemies in both close-range and long-range combat.<br>
They typically wear Light Armor that significantly lowers their defense, however they compensate for it with evasion and moving speed.<br>
