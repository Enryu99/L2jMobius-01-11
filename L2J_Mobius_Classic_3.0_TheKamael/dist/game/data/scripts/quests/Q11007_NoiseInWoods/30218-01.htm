Elven Forest is the symbol of our race, our legacy. We have to protect it. But this is not an easy task. Especially now, when it's flooded with so many strangers. This means we need the help of adventurers such as you. I'd like to ask for your assistance. Here, take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Security</font>. It is used for marking the completed quests among those that I'm going to give you. Well, good luck!<br>
