Did guards send you? Are you a mercenary? Hmm...<br>
Fine, let's get down to business. We got into this nasty mess recently. Ol Mahums have attacked the caravan headed to Gludio and have taken, among other things,<font color="LEVEL"> 10 Armor Stubs</font>. These stubs should have been delivery to a Human named Amora. The word is she values accuracy and strict abidance to the contracts... If she does not receive the goods on time she might stop any trade with our city. And if other Traders find out about it they might follow. Meaning huge losses for us...<br>
I beg you! <font color="LEVEL"> Find the goods stolen by Ol Mahums and return it to Armor</font>. You can find her to the West of Fellmere Lake.<br>
By the way, I can tell you something interesting while you're still here. Some really juicy rumors reached me lately...<br>
