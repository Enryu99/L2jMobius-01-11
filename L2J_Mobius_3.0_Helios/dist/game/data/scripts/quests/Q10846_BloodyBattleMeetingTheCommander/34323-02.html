I found just a while ago that the fortress is becoming more systemized.<br>
They've built a supply base, and I saw that they are distributing supplies to the soldiers within the fortress. I would love to go and destroy their supply base...<br>
Recently, I met Devianne, and she told me about the commander of the fortress.<br>
She said to create uproars around the fortress to stop the flow of their work inside... Do you think you can help me?<br>
