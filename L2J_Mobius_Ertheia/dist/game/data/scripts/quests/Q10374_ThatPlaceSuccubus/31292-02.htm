Those are the words of Agnes. According to her, some wandering Kamaels sought her out, told her the story, and requested her help. We don't know if the story is true, but we cannot ignore it either.
 It is definitely true that the Succubus monsters are gaining strength. Our territory is being threatend more  and more by them, but I cannot send out troops just on the word of some wandering Kamaels... What a bind<br>
 Can you investigate this mattr? Then we will know whether their words are true or not.<br>
