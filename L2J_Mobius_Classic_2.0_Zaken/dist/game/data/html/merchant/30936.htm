I have been wandering around the world seeking jewels for 100 years. I'm quite exhausted... I think I'll have some rest here. I like this place. Hoho!<br>
Huh? Who are you? Did you bring anything?<br>
I'm only interested in rare items; however, you've worked hard to find me. That's why I am going to show you what I have.Hmm... I wonder what might fit your needs...</br>
