So you'd like to know about the Monkey Bait, hmm? It's a type of bait that I've cooked up, and the fish love it! They can't get enough!<br>
Fishing with the <font color="LEVEL">Monkey Bait</font>, you'll be able to <font color="LEVEL">fish faster than before</font>! You'll also <font color="LEVEL">get more XP</font>.<br>
Sometimes, you'll get lucky and catch a <font color="LEVEL">Chef Monkey's Treasure Chest</font>. I lost it when the fish swarmed around me! But if you manage to fish the Treasure Chest around using my bait, it's yours! I don't have much need for it.<br>
