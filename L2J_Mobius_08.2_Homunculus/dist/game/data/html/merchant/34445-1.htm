You want to learn about Fallen Angel's Accessory? Fallen Angels are known as the children of Gran Kain, the god of chaos. There was almost no research on them.<br>
We only became aware of the Fallen Angels recently because <font color="LEVEL">the Fallen Angel's Accessory</font> were discovered. We weren't able to find out how the power of the Fallen Angels came to be contained in accessories but the Wizards were able to create <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: Enchant Fallen Angel Accessory</font> that could boost the Fallen Angel's power within.<br>
Boosting the power of a Fallen Angel is a very difficult task. If you happen to have a <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Angel's Ring with +9 enchantment</font>, I'll put it in a Treasure Chest for a special exchange.<br>
