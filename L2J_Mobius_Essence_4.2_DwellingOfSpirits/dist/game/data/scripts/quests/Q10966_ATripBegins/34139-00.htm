Gludio Captain Bathis is looking for promising adventurers. As far as I know, he is tasked with teaching them and molding them into worthy warriors.<br>
The area around the city is perfect for training, so I think you should go there.<br>
Also, don't go to the city immediately, first show off your Death Knight skills and gain a reputation.<br>
