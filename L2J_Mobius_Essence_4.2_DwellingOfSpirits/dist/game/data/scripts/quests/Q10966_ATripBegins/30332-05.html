You deserve a small gift for everything you've done. It'll help you become stronger. By the way, if you have an <font color="LEVEL">XP Scroll</font> in <font color="LEVEL">your inventory</font> you shouldn't hesitate to use it.<br>
And if you have a <font color="LEVEL">Weapon of Aden</font> use the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: Enchant Weapon of Aden</font> to make it <font color="LEVEL">better</font>.<br>
There's one more thing I'd like to give yyou. Here, take it. It's a special bracelet. The path you're on is a dangerous one and items like this can save your life.<br>
If you want I can tell you more about bracelets. Are you interested?<br>
