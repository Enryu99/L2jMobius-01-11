Orven: <br>
My young friend, you do not have enough experience to become a Cardinal. I see your passion and I hope that you will keep it in your heart, but it is not enough - only through the experience of battle you can acquire the power that will allow you not to deviate from your faith in the era of untruth. <br>
Come back when you are a little older and wiser. When you are ready, I will give you an assignment to check if you are ready to become a Cardinal. <br>
