 My mother is seriously ill! I've heard that<font color="LEVEL"> dead souls fish soup</font> might cure her, but it must be prepared by an excellent chef!<br>
 Please visit Gourmet Rifken in the Town of Aden region to the north and get some of this soup.<br>
 Bring it to me and I'll tell you a story.</body></html>
