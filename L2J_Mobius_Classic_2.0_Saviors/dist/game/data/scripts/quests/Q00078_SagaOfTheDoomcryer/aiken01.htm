Everyone is in an uproar about the coming winter! How do you prepare for something that might last forever?! Look at the Humans and the Dwarves! They have nice, thick winter coats and logs in their fireplaces! And meanwhile we, the keepers of the eternal fire, are threatened with extinction! We can't survive the endless winter without preparation! We should look to the Humans and Dwarves for an answer!<br>
