Bernard:
<br>
My young friend, you do not have enough experience to become a Ghost Sentinel. I see your passion and I hope that you will keep it in your heart, but it is not enough - only through the experience of battle you can acquire the power that will allow you not to deviate from your faith in the era of untruth. <br>
Come back when you are a little older and wiser. When you are ready, I will give you a mission to check if you are ready to become a Ghost Sentinel. <br>
(Quest for characters whose level is 76 or higher.)
