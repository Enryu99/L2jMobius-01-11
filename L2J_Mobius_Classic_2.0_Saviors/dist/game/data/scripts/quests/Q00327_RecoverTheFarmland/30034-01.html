So the rumors are true ... That the mercenaries fighting the Orcs on the northwest shores are secretly selling relics of the ancient kingdom ...<br>
How could they sell such valuable historical artifacts to businessmen ...! Objects that represent the lives of our ancestors ... They'll be degraded into mere decorations and displays ... This should not happen!<br>
Please ... If any relics of the ancient kingdom should chance to fall into your hands ... Don't sell them at the shop, but bring them to me ... I can't pay you, but ... I will try to share some of my knowledge with you ... And I will make sure that the relics that are recovered will all be used as research material for the researchers of the Ivory Tower.<br>
