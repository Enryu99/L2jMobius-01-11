What?! Have you seen Turek Orcs in Abandoned Camp? That means... These monsters have joined forces and are about to attack us together. It's a disaster!<br>
...But I think we should no hurry with our report to Sir Vasper. We have to get concrete evidence first, kill<font color="LEVEL"> Turek Orc Commanders</font> near Orc Barracks and search them to find out something about their plans. Time is the essence. I am asking you to hurry.<br>
