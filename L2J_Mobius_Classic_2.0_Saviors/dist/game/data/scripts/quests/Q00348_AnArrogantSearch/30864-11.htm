The Book of Saint One! You have found a relic! Great work! I use it to find out how you can resist a mad king. In the meantime, I have to ask you for one more favor.
Nothing complicated ... Oh, how tired I am! Please, go to the next shop and bring me  <font color="LEVEL">Major Healing Potion</font>.By your return, I just have it all figured out.
I apologize for making this request, but please do it for me.<br>
