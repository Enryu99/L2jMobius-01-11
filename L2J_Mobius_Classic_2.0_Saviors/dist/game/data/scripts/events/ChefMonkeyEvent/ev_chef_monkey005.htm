You'd like to hear about Chef Monkey's Banana Herb, eh? Haha, it's quite something!<br>
When I first arrive on the Aden continent, I didn't know anything, so I ended up cooking for the monsters! They loved it. When the monsters who had eaten my food died, they dropped Banana Herbs. It was strange.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Chef Monkey's Banana Herb</font> increases <font color="LEVEL">P. Atk., M. Atk, P. Def., and M. Def. by 50% for 5 minutes, and increases XP and SP gained by 10%</font>!<br>
I've cooked for a lot of monsters! Go out and hunt them!<br>
