<html><body>Captain Mouen:<br>
Welcome to Oren village. I am Mouen, and I am in charge of the security of this village.<br>
As you may know, Oren is close to Elmore, the nation Aden wars with. Because of that, we maintain a meticulous security system. It may well inconvenience you, but understand that the measures we have put in place are vital for our ongoing existence.<br>
Please understand, the residents here are not very different in either appearance or customs, to our neighbors to the north. In fact, to those who make their living cutting down trees, national boundaries mean little. Off the top of my head, I can name at least 10 residents who have relatives or friends in Elmore!<br>
That imposing castle on the northern hill, that's Oren Castle. Whenever I look at it, I pray that Elmore recognizes its power so our residents will not have to suffer the calamity of war ever again.<br>
