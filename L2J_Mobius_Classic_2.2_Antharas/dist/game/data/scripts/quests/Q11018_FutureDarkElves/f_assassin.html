<html><body>Class description - Assassin<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Assassins</font> are Dark Elven Warriors who prefer Daggers and Bows.<br>
In combat they use Daggers and Biws, which allows them to effectively dispose of enemies in both close-range and long-range combat. They typically wear Light Armor that significantly loers their defens, however they compensate for it with their excellent evasion Skills and moving speed.<br>
Compared to similiar Classes of other Races they have higher P. Atk. and a high chance of dealing critical damage. This is the most effective Class for a single-player game because of its many personal Reinforcement Skills.<br>
