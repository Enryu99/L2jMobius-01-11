<html><body>Class description - Elven Scout<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Elven Scouts</font> are Elven warriors who prefer to fight with a Bow and a Dagger.<br>
In combat, they use Daggers and Bows, which allows them to effectively dispose of enemies in both close-range and lon-range combat. they typically wear Light Armor that significantly lowers their defense, however they compensate for it with their excellent evasion Skills and moving speed.<br>
Compared to similar Classes of other Races they have higher moving speed and high chance of dealing critical damage. This is the most effective Class for a single-player game because of its many personal Reinforcement Skills.<br>
