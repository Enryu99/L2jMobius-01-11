<html><body>Mysterious Dark Knight:<br>
Ye bound by the Red Thread of Fate...<br>
So you have been following the pull of your destiny. Lighting Shilen's darkness, breathing life to the dying Mother Tree, filling the emptiness in Kamaels' hearts... the flame you lit at the Pa'agrio Temple will go to touch the Orcs with that person's fond heart.<br>
Your part is done. Now return, and march onward toward your destiny.<br>
Do not forget what you have seen here - you shall never see this place again.<br>
