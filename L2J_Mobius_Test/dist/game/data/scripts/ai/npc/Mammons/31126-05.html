I will exchange the weapon for another type of the same grade. For example, you can exchange a mithril dagger for a two-handed claymore of the same grade. But, I have to warn you.<br>
First, when exchanging a weapon with a <font color="LEVEL">Soul Crystal effect</font>, the exchanged weapon will not have the effect.<br>
Second, when exchanging a weapon that has been <font color="LEVEL">enchanted</font> the exchanged weapon will have the same enchantment.<br>
Third, if you exchange a weapon that has <font color="LEVEL">changed in appearance</font>, the appearance will not be maintained.<br>
