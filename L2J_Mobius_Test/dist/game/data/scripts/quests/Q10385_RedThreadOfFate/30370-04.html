You heard me. There used to be a building housing the gems of a saint called Enfeux. Now, what purer ensemble of souls than the gems of a saint? Though I did hear that Enfeux has shattered with only parts remaining.<br>
I see. Must be linked somehow to the main in the dark armor that came by. Oh, stop it with the puppy-dog eyes. I'm sure you'll get to meet him someday too.<br>
Well, if you're interested, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Valley of Saints</font> to look for the remaining <font color="LEVEL">Enfeux</font>.<br>
Use the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape: Valley of Saints</font> I gave you.
