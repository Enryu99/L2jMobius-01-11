You must be an incredible warrior to defeat Sakum! I knew your skills weren't ordinary, and now ... now I'm alive because of you!<br>
Listen, Sakum is rampaging through Gludio territory and absorbing bio-energy by using Poslof, Kanilov, and Ancient Creature Kartia.<br>
It seems like all of their energies are then sent to the heart Shine Stone located within Sakum's body. now if the Shine Stone is a mana stone from the Time of Giants... does that mean that Sakum was created by the ancient giants?<br>
