Thanks you! You're first one who wanted to help.<br1>
I'm touched!<br>
Now go help spirits!<br>
I will give you keys. Go unshackle <font color=LEVEL>Captured Tree Spirits</font> and <font color=LEVEL>Captured Wind Spirits</font> and <font color=LEVEL>free</font> them!<br>
And make sure no one can shackle spirits again by bringing <font color=LEVEL>10 Broken Chains</font>!
