High priest Orven, sent you to help, right? Great. The Captain ordered me to direct you to the underground crypt when you arrived. The soldiers are already there, battling monsters. Please hurry, they're going to need all the help they can get.<br>
Powerfull monsters are encamped there right now. So let me teleport you there. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous.<br>
