Welcome! I am Talbot. I'm here to explain the benefits and drawbacks of the classes you can choose from.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Human Fighters</font> focus on short-range melee attacks, and can handle basic weapons and armor types.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Human Mages</font> have an innate affinity for the power of the spoken word. They use Elemental Magic, White Magic, Support Magic, Dark Magic and Summon Magic!<br>
When your abilities improve, the<font color="LEVEL">Skill Window</font> will appear showing any new skills you can learn. You can check your list of skills by using the shortcut key <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font>.
