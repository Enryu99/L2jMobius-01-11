This is the pier for Gludio Airships. Airships headed for the continent of Gracia also arrive and depart from here.<br>
We tap into a strong aura of power and depend on favorable winds to allow the Airships to travel such a far distance.<br>
If you're not ready to leave for Gracia yet, you'd best go back.<br>
((If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 76 or below</font>, you may teleport for free.)<br>
