<html><body>Priestess of Light Razen:<br>
The power you attained through <font color="LEVEL">Awakening</font> - it is great power, yes, but it is the power of the Giants. <font color="LEVEL">Skills</font> in particular are the essence of the Giants' abilities.<br>
But for Triol the devil, the greatest weapon would be the power of the light bestowed by Einhasad the goddess.<br>
No need to look disappointed or regret Awakening, however. Excluding skills and servitors' abilities, all of your general attacks are imbued with the <font color="LEVEL">power of the light inside you</font>. They will be critical in defeating the pagans.<br>
