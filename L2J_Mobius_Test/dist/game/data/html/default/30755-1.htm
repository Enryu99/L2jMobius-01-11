Portal Stones are the key to entering Antharas' Nest.<br>
They are only given to <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Slayers</font> as named by the <font color="LEVEL">Guardians of the Seals</font>. If you're serious about facing down Antharas, go to <font color="LEVEL">Gabrille</font>, the leader of the guardians, and prove your woth to her. Only then will I give you a Portal Stone.
