Sebion is injured?! How? I know he was conducting research in the Labyrinth of Belis... which is not exactly a cake walk, but what happened? Hmm... He's going to need someone to help dig and carry. I'll send over some additional bodies to help out.<br>
And, we'll need a Bloodhound to protect him on his return. Bloodhounds are rather pricey right now, but we certainly can't afford any more severe injuries, or deaths! Thanks for your report. We be in touch, when we have need of your skills again.
