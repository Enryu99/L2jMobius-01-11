Yes. I need help. The last time the gates opened, Aden Vanguard detachment burst into the Legion Headquarters, but so far there has been no news from them.<br>
While I will keep the gate, enter the Legion Headquarters, find the Aden Vanguard Members and destroy Bernstein. Don't worry: even if the gate closes, you will be able to get out.<br>
After you deal with Burnshine, report this to Elric.
