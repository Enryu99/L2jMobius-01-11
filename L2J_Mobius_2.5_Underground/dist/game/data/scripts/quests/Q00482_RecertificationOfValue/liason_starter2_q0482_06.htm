If we want to win in this war against Shilen, we need to slap the power from her hands to give us an extra edge. SheΞ�Β²Ξ²β€�Β¬Ξ²β€�Ξ†s the one whoΞ�Β²Ξ²β€�Β¬Ξ²β€�Ξ†s behind the recent plethora of disasters and in order to fight her we need someone to get their hands a little dirty to win. We have an operative located at the <font color="LEVEL">Tower of Insolence</font> ready to brief you if you want to take the gig. WeΞ�Β²Ξ²β€�Β¬Ξ²β€�Ξ†re running low on resources so we canΞ�Β²Ξ²β€�Β¬Ξ²β€�Ξ†t send her in to handle the task if that was what you were thinking.<br>
Krasis has given the okay to allow contract adventures to assist us in our missions. Unfortunately, there is no financial compensation, but youΞ�Β²Ξ²β€�Β¬Ξ²β€�Ξ†ll get experience performing these types of missions and earn all types of credit with the Krasis.<br>
