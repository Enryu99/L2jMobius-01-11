Excellent! Thank you!<br>
I want you to speak to <font color="LEVEL">Chesha</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Exploration Zone 1</font>, and tell her that "Lakcis is ready to go to ruins whenver". I realize they won't allow me in just yet, but I want them to know that I'm snapping at their heels. It's imperative that I gain access to the ruins!<br>
Now, to get inside, I believe you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Ye Sagira Teleportation Device</font>. Go, and be safe!
