I heard the Eye of Argos talking about some kind of <font color="LEVEL">Powerful Dark Malice</font> you can get from monsters--the same ones that have the Evil Eyes of Darkness, it seems.<br>
Thing is, the <font color="LEVEL">Evil Eyes of Darkness</font> are easy enough to collect if you just keep at it. The Malice, though, I'm not certain. I'm sure it'll come clear once you've worked on the Eyes for long enough.<br>
Tell you what, since the Malice is so tricky, I'll make it worth extra to you. Got it?<br>
