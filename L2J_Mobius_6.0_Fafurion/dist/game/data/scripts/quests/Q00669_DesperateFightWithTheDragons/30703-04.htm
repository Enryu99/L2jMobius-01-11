The Hunter Guild has kept close ties with the Aden Court. According to the mutual defense agreement between Aden, we have been assigned to defeat <font color="LEVEL">Antharas, Valakas, Lindvior and Fafurion</font>. Some of them are already in the Extreme state. We have to eliminate them. Can you handle it?
