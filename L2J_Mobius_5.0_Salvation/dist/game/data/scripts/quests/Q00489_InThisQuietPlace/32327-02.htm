<font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights and Shrine Royal Guards</font> have infested the Shrine of Loyalty.<br>
But it's never that simple, right? Some of them are infused with <font color="LEVEL">Traces of Evil Spirit</font>, possibly as many as <font color="LEVEL">700</font>! But no one would agree to kill that many, so if you can collect <font color="LEVEL">77</font> of them for now, I'm authorized to give a reward.<br>
