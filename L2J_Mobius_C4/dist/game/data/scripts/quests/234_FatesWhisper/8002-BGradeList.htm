Did you bring all 984 Grade B Crystals? You came just in time. We've reached the perfect temperature for inserting the Crystals...<br>
Uh huh, it's not over yet! I still need one more ingredient. Pure Infernium is too soft to be made into weapons. It must be mixed with high quality Mithril in order to make an alloy.<br>
But it's just so hard to find good Mithril ore these days... The most reliable method is to melt a Grade B weapon down and use it instead. Understand?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Now tell me, what kind of Grade B weapon can you bring? I'll have to adjust the temperature and the component ratio for the molten liquid, so you cannot change type of weapon later. Choose carefully!</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, bear in mind that any enchantment or special ability possessed by the original weapon will disappear immediately when it is thrown into the furnace!</font><br>
