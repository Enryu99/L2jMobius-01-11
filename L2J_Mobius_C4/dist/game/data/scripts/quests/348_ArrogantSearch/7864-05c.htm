A long time ago, three sacred relics were locked away and hidden away. In time, people have managed to find some mysterious treasure boxes that are thought to contain the relics. However, they are all guarded by strong monsters...so naturally, you will have to kill these guardians in order to get the relics!<br>
Meet with <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font> in Giran Castle Town. He will give you the location of the ark containing the sacred relic, by marking it on the map with a red flag. Once you find and retrieve the sacred relic, the red mark will disappear. Now, go and collect the sacred relic. (If the flag disappears before you find the sacred relic, return to the person who marked its location on the map and make your inquiry again. The flag will reappear).<br>
I have given you a letter to give to him. I explain everything to him there. Talk to him, find the relic, and give it to the one doing the quest when you are done!
