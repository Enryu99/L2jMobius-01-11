<tr><td>Shilen, Mother of the Abyss, is the Goddess</td></tr>
<tr><td>who controls fate and death. Shilen permits all</td></tr>
<tr><td>life to be limited, and it is she who enables</td></tr>
<tr><td>death, so that all livingthing can return to</td></tr>
<tr><td>their original state of nothingness. Other races</td></tr>
<tr><td>do not understand the eternal cycle of birth</td></tr>
<tr><td>and death. They only see one side of death,</td></tr>
<tr><td>and fear and hate Shilen.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Beacuse of these prejudices, in the Human</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kingdom, the mark of Shilen hanging around</td></tr>
<tr><td>one's neck will lead to being burnt at the stake</td></tr>
<tr><td>for heresy. In  spite of this persecution, there</td></tr>
<tr><td>are secret groups of Humans who follow the</td></tr>
<tr><td>Goddess Shilen. In a sense, their faith is the</td></tr>
<tr><td>same as the Dark Elves. If only we could know</td></tr>
<tr><td>who they were.</td></tr><br>
