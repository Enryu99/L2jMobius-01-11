My mind keeps drifting to the past. In the old days, this wharf was bustling with activity. A new fleet of trading ships from Gracia entered every day! It had far more traffic than Giran or Heine in the South.<br>
Ever since the war our diplomatic ties with Gracia have been severed, and the trading ships don't come here anymore. Only the occasional cruise liner with adventurers on board comes to anchor.<br>
Oh, I almost forgot. By the way, a regular liner that travels to Gludin Harbor of Gludio in Aden Kingdom just started operating. During its trial period, the fare is free. So why don't you try it out? It might be fun!<br>
