<center>Welcome to your new community board !<br>
<br>
Admin, you can customize this file by editing the file index.htm, in directory 'data/html/ComunityBoard' of your DataPack.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can also make links like : <a action="bypass _bbstop;1">My link</a><br>
The link must be bypass _bbstop;X with X a integer like bypass _bbstop;1<br>
The link bypass _bbstop;1 shows the file 1.htm of your 'data/html/ComunityBoard',bypass _bbstop;2 the file 2.html etc...<br>
<br>
<br>
Community Board can support html 3 times longer than a classical npc dialog html !<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Be Careful : client crashes if the html is not valid for it !</center>
