<tr><td>Looking at young Elves today, I think that they</td></tr>
<tr><td>are like fragile flowers growing under the shade</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the Mother Tree. Granted, they learn the</td></tr>
<tr><td>use of the bow or arrow from many fine</td></tr>
<tr><td>masters, or magic to command the elements</td></tr>
<tr><td>from wise sorcerors, but that is purely</td></tr>
<tr><td>academic, and I worry that they may not be</td></tr>
<tr><td>able to perform well in actual battle. Thus, I</td></tr>
<tr><td>have always advocated that young Elves need</td></tr>
<tr><td>to actively go into the battlefield and recieve</td></tr>
<tr><td>actual training.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>I'm sure you also want to see the result of</td></tr>
<tr><td>your   training,   and   also   receive</td></tr>
<tr><td>acknowledgement of your skills? Soon the orc</td></tr>
<tr><td>tribes from the Misty Mountains and our Elven</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fighters will be having a skirmish. When the</td></tr>
<tr><td>time comes, I will give you the chance to</td></tr>
<tr><td>participate in battle.</td></tr><br>
