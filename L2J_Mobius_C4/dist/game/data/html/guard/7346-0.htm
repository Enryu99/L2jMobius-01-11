<tr><td>Greetings. Have you seen many places? My</td></tr>
<tr><td>wish is to adventure in the wide, outside world</td></tr>
<tr><td>someday. When I give up my job as sentry. I</td></tr>
<tr><td>am thinking of travelling to Elmore. If you go</td></tr>
<tr><td>there, there is the village of <font color="LEVEL">Pabell</font> built by</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dark Elves</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Maybe it's just because of the oppressive</td></tr>
<tr><td>atmosphere that hangs around the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts,</font></td></tr>
<tr><td>but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.</td></tr><br>
