<html><body>Feed Seller:<br>
Welcome to our pastures! Would you like to try your hand at raising a wild beast? If you're good, he'll obey you, if not, he'll make a good dinner! You have your choice of feed, <font color="LEVEL">gold spice</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Crystal Spice</font>.<br>
Gold spice fattens them up while the Crystal Spice makes them tougher. If you want to raise a fat beast, feed it gold spice. If you want to raise a robust beast, feed it Crystal Spice.<br>
Maybe you should try both, and compare!<br>
