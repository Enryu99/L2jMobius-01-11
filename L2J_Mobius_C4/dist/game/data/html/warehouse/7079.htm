<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Barder:<br>
Hmm... Are you going to make a deposit? This town has been bustling with activity lately, with the coming and going of foreigners. I m stuck here as a Warehouse Keeper now, but I used to be part of a successful party once. I ve been to many places and seen lots of things, and based on my experience, I tell you, greed is useless in life... Though you might be surprised to hear that coming from a Dwarf.<br>
