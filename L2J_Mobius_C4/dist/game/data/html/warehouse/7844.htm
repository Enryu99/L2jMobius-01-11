<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
When you are running a warehouse, whether you like it or not, you get to know all sorts of odd secrets. For example, a few days ago, some high level official whose name I cannot reveal placed with us a very cute needlework doll. The doll was very well made, but it seemed like it wasn' t worth the storage fee we charge. What do you think this means? Heh heh heh<br>
