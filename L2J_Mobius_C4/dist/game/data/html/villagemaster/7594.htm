<html><body>Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
I am Warehouse Chief Ranspo of the Iron Gate Guild here in Gludio. Our guild’s motto is to 'sell anything to any race if it is needed.' We are not hindtered by the snowy fields, deserts, or volcanic regions. We are a magnificent guild that operates in all parts of the world, increasing the economic prosperity of the Dwarven race. Ha ha ha, aren’t we magnificent?<br>
But you seem like a new face. Have we met before? Anyway, why have you come to me?<br>
