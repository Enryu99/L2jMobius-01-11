Humph! I've got a headache. They say that dreviant wine contains spider venom and I'm starting to think that is true. Darn... I had it delivered as usual in Dark Elven Village and Sedrick must have drank three bottles of it all by himself...! That great one who is like a Dwarf! Desmo! You're no different! Do you think you'll conquer the world just because you can drink well?<br>
Huh? Oh, oh! You've done a good thing to come to our Mage Guild at Aden Castle Town. I am Grand Magister Drikiyan. But who are you?<br>
