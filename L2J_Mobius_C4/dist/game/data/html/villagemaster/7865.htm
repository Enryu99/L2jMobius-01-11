Adventurer, you've done well to come to the city of the Humans. Humans needed the help of myself and my race during this time that they call the era of chaos and came directly to request it of Flame Lord Kakai. Spirit of Ancestor Martankus and Ungote of the Duda-Mara tribe say that there is a connection between this and the "eternal mirror" that is the only thing that causes fear in us Orcs...<br>
It means a lot to us that the we, the children of Paagrio, have come to the prosperity of the kingdom of Humans that were our enemies at one time.<br>
