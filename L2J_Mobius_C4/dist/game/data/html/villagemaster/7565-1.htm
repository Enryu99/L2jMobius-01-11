<html><body><tr><td>Flame Lord Kakai:</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>You, warrior of our race... I shall tell you of the</td></tr><tr><td>Overlord, the high level Shaman of our race, so</td></tr><tr><td>listen carefully! They are those born with the</td></tr><tr><td>fate of ruling over others! Should they become</td></tr><tr><td>lords that lead a clan, the members of that clan</td></tr><tr><td>shall all display remarkable power!</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>Traditionally, we Orcs have chosen the chief of</td></tr><tr><td>a tribe from among the Overlords. In order to</td></tr><tr><td>become an Overlord, a Shaman must pass the</td></tr><tr><td>severe Trial of the Lord. I endured this trial as</td></tr><tr><td>a youngster in order to become the Overlord of</td></tr><tr><td>the Hestui! The lord or chief that you will be</td></tr><tr><td>serving in the future will also have passed this</td></tr><tr><td>trial, so treat them with the reverence and</td></tr><tr><td>honour that they deserve!</td></tr><br>
