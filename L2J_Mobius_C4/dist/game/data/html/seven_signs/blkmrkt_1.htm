<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
The Lords of Dawn and Revolutionaries of Dusk, in keeping with the ageless traditions of the empire, use<font color="LEVEL"> Ancient Adena</font> as currency.<br>
You know, traditions are one thing, but they won't buy anything at the market!<br>
Do you have any Ancient Adena you need to get rid of? I can handle that for you.<br>
By the way, if you're tired of the special ability that is bestowed upon your weapon, I can remove it... Although, for the life of me, I can't understand why you would want to do that... But make up your own mind... As long as you've got the money, you're the boss...<br>
