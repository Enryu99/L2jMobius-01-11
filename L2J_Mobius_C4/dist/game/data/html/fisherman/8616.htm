This fishing resort is on the sea, not far from the kingdom of Elmore. This has been a fishing resort since ancient times. The lack of boat traffic means that the fishing around here is wonderful! You'll find many rare species here that are found nowhere else!<br>
Isn't it quiet and beautiful? I hope you have a wonderful time! If you need anything, please come see me.<br>
