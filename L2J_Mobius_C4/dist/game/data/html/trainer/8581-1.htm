<html><body>Enchant A Skill:<br>
Skills may be enhanced and reinforced by various forms of enchantment. Any player who has completed his third occupation change and reached level 76 or above can enchant his skill with the help of a skill trainer.<br>
When enchanting a skill for the first time, pay particular attention to the methods of reinforcement. If there are at least two, the method will be determined during the first enchantment session. When enchanting a skill, carefully note the descriptions of each effect before choosing.<br>
Also pay particular attention to the success rate. All skill enchantments have a set success rate. If enchantment fails, Exp. and SP will be consumed and your skill will return to +0 status. The success rate improves as the player's level increases.<br>
The following NPCs perform all skill enchantments. Seek the one that matches your tribe and occupation.<br>
