Half of the Ivory Tower was once destroyed during the Elmoraden Empire. At that time the Ivory Tower had enough power to control the continent, but after that incident it changed in to a facility which purely did research and education.<br>
Other Magisters say that we must try hard to restore our old regime, but I personally think that the way the Ivory Tower functions today is better.<br>
