May the smile of Eva bring you peace and tranquility. Ah, ha... I'm a bit embarrased to speak a greeting like this in the temple of Einhasad who is the mother of light. Giran is the center of commerce and Oren is the center of military strength. Here in Aden, we focus on culture and religion.<br>
OK, as it's the center of religion, what good wishes should I give you here in the very middle of it all at the temple of the god of light?<br>
