<html><body>Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>
So you want a dual sword, eh? You've come to the right place! We can create every type but A grade!<br>
For that you'll need to see the <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>!<br>
We don't need no stinking certificates to make our swords!<br>
Just bring the swords and a few stones of purity for me...<br>
Remember, swords that have had skills added to them can't be combined!<br>
Check out the list!<br>
