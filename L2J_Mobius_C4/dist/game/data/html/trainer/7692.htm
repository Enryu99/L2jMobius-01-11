Have you been to the Enchanted Valley? It is said that fairies live there, hidden. In the past, there was a strange trend of collecting parts of fairies' bodies and that is why the Fairies and the King of the Fairies hide in the woods.<br>
If this is true how frightened will they be, watching the vast amount of adventurers searching the place...? May the song of stars give you happiness.<br>
Now, what can I do for you?<br>
