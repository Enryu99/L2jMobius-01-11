<tr><td>Well, I can never be too busy to talk about our</td></tr>
<tr><td>guild.</td></tr><br>
<tr><td>While other races were brandishing their</td></tr>
<tr><td>bamboo spears and stone axes, our ancestors</td></tr>
<tr><td>had already fashioned bronse tools and begun</td></tr>
<tr><td>to learn the secrets of steel. The Black Anvil</td></tr>
<tr><td>Guild continues the traditions of those</td></tr>
<tr><td>ancestors through delicate workmanship and a</td></tr>
<tr><td>noble sprit of craftmanship. Our guild</td></tr>
<tr><td>produces all the great craftsman of the Dwarven</td></tr>
<tr><td>history. Our mithril weapons and adamantite</td></tr>
<tr><td>armour are traded at the highest prices at any</td></tr>
<tr><td>market.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Also, our guild members study the lost science</td></tr>
<tr><td>and technology of the giants more deeply than</td></tr>
<tr><td>anyone else. The seige golems and airships</td></tr>
<tr><td>that we produce are the results of such</td></tr>
<tr><td>studies. Tell me, what do you think of that?</td></tr><br>
