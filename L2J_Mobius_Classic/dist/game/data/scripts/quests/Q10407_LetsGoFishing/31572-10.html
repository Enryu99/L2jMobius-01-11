Oh, one more thing. I need to tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Shot</font>. This is a kind of the Soulshot made for fishing. Use it while fishing to <font color="LEVEL">increase your odds of catching a fish</font>. For added convenience, register it in tool tips to use it automatically. If you need to buy any, come to me.<br>
That's all. Do you need me to go again?<br>
