<html><body>Gerkenshtein:<br>As I was saying, yes these creatures are quite different that the ones who used to roam the area. My Cryptozoology is a bit rusty, but it appears they are a rare species of Succubus. These creatures do not appear to have any of the traditional characteristics of a true Succubus with the exception of their one desire to drain the life out of you. Again, I would like for you to find out if these cratures are here due Shilen.<br>
I`m afraid it this task isn`t as easy as watching elpies. It requires a bit more of a hands-on approach. I need you to kill a fair amount of these Succubus creatures and observe their reactions.<br>
