We've found several <font color="LEVEL">Unidentified Suspicious Badges</font> on monsters. We're assuming they're what's making the monsters violent, but we're not entirely sure. <font color="LEVEL">Bacon</font> is here to help determine that. He's the favorite disciple of <font color="LEVEL">Paterson</font>, a famous scholar of Aden.<br>
The problem is: he needs <font color="LEVEL">Unidentified Suspicious Badges</font> to for his research, but he's not the fighting type. Since they're only found on monsters, he's obviously not making much progress.<br>
