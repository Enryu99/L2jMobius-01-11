Soon the Land Dragon will awake from his slumber. Giran, no, the entire kingdom is in mortal danger! You must hurry to <FONT color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</FONT>. Bring me <FONT color="LEVEL">Thunder Wyrm Eggs, Drake Eggs, Blitz Wyrm Eggs and Mist Drake Eggs</FONT> there. And just one or two is not enough. I'll need <FONT color="LEVEL">10 of each</FONT>. You must do whatever it takes to accomplish this task. And one more thing... Blitz Wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare and will be very difficult to find. If you see the Dwarves that I sent earlier, they may be able to help you. Good luck.
