<html><body>Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
I'm Head Blacksmith Kusto of the Black Anvil Guild here in Giran. Unlike those mercenaries in the Iron Gate guild, we work for more than simple profit. The joy in creating something worthwhile and beautiful should have a greater purpose than to hear a few gold coins jangling in your purse, eh?<br>
Enough of my prattle! What has brought you to me? I'll help you in whatever way I can.<br>
