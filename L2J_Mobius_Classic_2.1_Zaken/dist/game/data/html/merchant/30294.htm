I've heard strong warnings against going into bisiness with family, but I must say it's worked out rather well for my sister and me. I love the customers, and she has a great head for business. Why, just recently, she made a deal with the Ivory-Tower of Oren, and with the master craftsdwarves of the Flame Breath guild. You won't find their wares at prices like this anywhere else!<br>
