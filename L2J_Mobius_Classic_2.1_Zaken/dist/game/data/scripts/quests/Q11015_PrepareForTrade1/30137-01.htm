Greetings! You're the one Payne sent to me? He ordered some materials for making a shield from me, but they're turned to be pretty hard to get. I gathered everything except <font color="LEVEL">Stone Giant Guardian's Core</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Crystalline Beast's Shinedust </font>and <font color="LEVEL">Giant Spider Skin Fragment</font>. This <font color="LEVEL">Supplies Certificate</font> tells all details of where you can obtain them. May I ask you to take the gathering of these materials upon yourself?<br>
