<html><body>Head Priest of the Earth Gerald:<br>
As soon as I've finished, Priest Daichir will stop being angry with me. He is bound to notice, how well I cleaned the temple. Daichir is not as heartless as he tries to look. I can't cope with such a difficult task alone, though. That's why I'm asking you to help me.
