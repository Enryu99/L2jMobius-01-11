There can never be too many Spiritshots.<br>
Thanks to you, I may start the repairs. The only thing is... that I might have another request. Daichir recently ordered me to clean up the temple. Of course, Maphr's Temple must be shining clean, but why do I have to scrub it all on my own?! Oh yes, and the mess was so bad, that all cleaning tools went out of order right way. I asked Daichir to buy new ones, but he told me to deal with it myself. So I decided to craft them. I wish I had time to look for the necessary materials. So many things to do... For that reason I would like to ask you to bring me materials for cleaning tools.<br>
