<html><body>Blacksmith Altran:<br>
Have you been sent by Newbie Guide? Excellent! I have a task for you. The fifth generation of my family lives here. My grandfather and great-grandfather are buried not far from here. Every time, when the life gets rough, I go to grandfather's grave and talk to him in my mind. Unfortunately, there have been too many wolves and orcs lately. And werewolves made a habit of digging up the graves! If we leave it as it is, my ancestral tombs will disappear. Please, kill Wolves, Orcs and Werewolves nearby the village and bring me some items as a proof.<br>
I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Memo</font>. Kill the monsters, listed in it. You can start with Wolves. There are plenty of them near the exit from the village.<br>
Look up the memo and kill the monsters, listed in it.
