<html><body>Blacksmith Sumari:<br>
Did Centurion send you? Do you have Butcher's Sword for Newbies? I made it for Orcs, who praise our tribe. I have to craft so many weapons, that I always run out of materials. Quite recently, I depleted my last stores, so I can't work any longer.<br>
Here's the list of <font color="LEVEL">Required Items</font>. Bring me everything that's on it. I hope you will make no mistakes with this list. It's no use to me anyway, for I can't read.<br>
