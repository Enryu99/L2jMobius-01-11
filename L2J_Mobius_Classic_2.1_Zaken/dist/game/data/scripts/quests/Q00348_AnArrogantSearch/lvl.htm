Listen... I'll tell you a story about an ancient king who received eternal life, but he paid for it, and the gods imprisoned him in a high tower. Having spent many, many years in captivity, he went mad and turned into a monster. The key to eternal life, the mountains of the treasures of the ancient empire... and the secrets enveloping the seal... That's what the reward of this king is.<br>
