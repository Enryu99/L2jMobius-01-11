<html><body>Amora:<br>
I placed the order a month ago but the goods were delivered just now... The delivery was a full week late. And the merchandise is not that good either.<br>
Of course, I have heard of Ol Mahum attacks but that is not an excuse. One should just get proper guards.<br>
But then again, Ol Mahum have good mad indeed, I will let it go for now, but that is the last time. I will pay for the goods with a check. Pass it over to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Damion</font>. And make sure that it does noy happen again.
