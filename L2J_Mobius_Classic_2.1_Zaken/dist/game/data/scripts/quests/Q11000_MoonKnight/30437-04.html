You are still here? Have you forgotten the plan already? Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> instead of me to give the armor to Ol Mahums. Find <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Hierarch Gudz</font> there and tell him about Turek Orcs trachery. If Ol Mahums find out that they will not just sit there, they will attack to avenge themselves.<br>
Do not lose the Iron Scale Guild Certificate! This is a proof that you come from me. Go on now!
