A contract? Let's see... It is an contract for a large batch of armor. Look at the stamp. There is no doubt that is a sign of the Dwarven Guild. So, Dwarves are selling military equipment to Turek Orcs?<br>
Hmm... We have to find out wich of Dwarven Guild's is working with Tureck Orcs. We have to find out whose stamp is that but we cannot just ask the Dwarves themselves...<br>
By the way! Do you know <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font>? She lives nearby. We can ask her! The word is Neti lived near Schuttgart when she was young. She knows Dwarves very well.
