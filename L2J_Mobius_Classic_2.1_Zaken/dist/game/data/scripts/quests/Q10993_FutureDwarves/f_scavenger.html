<html><body>Class description - Scavenger :<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> Scavengers </font>are Dwarves who travel the world looking for materials for making various items. <br>
They are able to collect various additional items and materials from monsters. Scavengers use Spoil and Sweeper Skills that they learned back in their Dwarven Fighter times.<br> 
They are not really effective in combat or during hunting, but you can earn a lot with them when collecting materials. That's why players who want to pursue item collecting choose Scavengers.<br>
