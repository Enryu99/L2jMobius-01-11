<html><body>Class description - Artisan:<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> Artisans </font>are Dwarves who work in creating items and equipment. They don't like traveling and prefer to stay in their workshops.<br>
They can't continue lerning Spoil and Sweeper Skills, so they are less effective when it comes to collecting materials. However, you can earn a lot through item-making.<br>
They are not very effective in combat or during hunting, but, unlike Scavengers, they can summon battle Mechanic Golems who will be a good asset in battles.<br>
