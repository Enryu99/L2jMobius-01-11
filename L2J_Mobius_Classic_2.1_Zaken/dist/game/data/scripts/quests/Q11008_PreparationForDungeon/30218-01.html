<html><body>Sentinel Kendell:<br>
Have you heard something about the battle that happened in the dungeon recently? I think you know. There has been many talks about it. One of Sentinels named Starden took part in that battle.<br>
They say he is going down there again. I think Starden wants to bring back remains of his friends. He is too busy and can't do anything about it right now, but he is going back to the dungeon at the earliest opportunity. I'm worried about him - such recklessness is just inviting trouble. Could you talk to Starden?<br>
