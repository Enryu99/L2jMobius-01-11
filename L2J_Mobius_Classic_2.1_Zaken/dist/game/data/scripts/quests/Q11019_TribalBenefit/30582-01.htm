You? Decided to work a little for the benefit of the tribe? Well, it's a sacred duty of every Orc, after all. I have a few appropriate tasks for you.<br>
I've recently seen a huge wolf pack not far from the town. These monsters are a threat to young Orcs, who can't stand up for themeselves yet. Hurry and get rid of <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Wolves and Kasha Timber Wolves</font>. There's another problem. <font color="LEVEL">Goblin Tomb Raiders</font> have been raiding out graves. We need to show them that Orcs will not overlook that! Kill them and return out ancestors bones. Besides, <font color="LEVEL">Maraku Werewolves</font> were spotted at the town outskirts. get rid of them, as well. And my last request is to find fresh <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Seer Tears</font>. We need them to treat our wounded Orcs.<br>
Here, take this <font color="LEVEL">Tribal Chronicle</font>. It has a detailed description of what you need to do.<br>
