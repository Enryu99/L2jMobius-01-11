Is this the one he requested?<br>
The flame that we need to sustain us through the endless winter! Along with countless dead souls... I can't just stand by and do nothing! I'll analyze the reports from you seers of the battlefield and manage the deployment of dead souls.<br>
It won't be easy for you guides of dead souls... Warcryer! Can you understand the minds of dead souls and speak on their behalf?<br>
