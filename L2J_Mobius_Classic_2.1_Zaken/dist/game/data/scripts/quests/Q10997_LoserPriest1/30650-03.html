You chose Soulshot, I see. There are never enough Soulshots on a journey.<br>
And one more thing... Could you, please, bring some more materials for the repairs? I keep receiving assignments on restoration of collapsed buildings. There are just too many, I'm out of materials! I understand that you're really busy, but I'm begging you to help me once more!<br>
