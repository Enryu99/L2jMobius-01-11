<html><body>Head Priest of the Earth Gerald:<br>
So, Zimenf mentioned me, huh? I'm so ashamed. I've got a week to restore the broken statue, otherwise Priest Daichir will be very angry. I need a big amount of money for the repairs, along with special supplies. I have got the money, alright, but I don't have the supplies I need. Please, help me.<br>
I can see you agree. Here, take this, it's <font color="LEVEL">Maintenance Request</font>. This cost sheet contains the list of all required supplies. Please, bring them to me.<br>
