Hello! We created special area in the Monster Arena for hard fights between characters in alliances. So go into battle for glory and power!<br>
To enter the Arena, members of one clan must form an <font color="LEVEL">alliance</font>, and clan leader must confirm leader's rights.<br>
Remember that you can go to Arena only for <font color="LEVEL">20 minutes</font>! Of course, you can extend residence time. Well spend this fee for various research than help us to improve Arena.<br>
Arena battles are held <font color="LEVEL">once a week</font>, the count is reset <font color="LEVEL">every Wednesday at 6:30 a.m</font>. Battle begins with <font color="LEVEL">Raid 20 Lv</font>. Level of available Raids grows gradually. Thanks to the progress' statistics higher level Raid will be available each week.<br>
The best thing is to have in alliance <font color="LEVEL">as many characters as possible</font>.<br>
