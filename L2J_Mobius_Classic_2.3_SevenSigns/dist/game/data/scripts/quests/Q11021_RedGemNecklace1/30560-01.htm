Are you saying Sumari sent you? Hmm, I remember promising him to make a Red Gem Necklace. But this is a very hard material, and all my tools got broken when I worked on it. I feel so bad that I can't keep that promise. Maybe, you could help me. Kill Kasha Bears and Kasha Spiders to get Bear's Shin Bones and Sharp Spider Legs. I will make hammers and chisels from them.<br>
