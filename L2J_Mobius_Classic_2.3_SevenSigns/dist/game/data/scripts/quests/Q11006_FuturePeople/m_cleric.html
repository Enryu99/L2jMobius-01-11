<html><body>Class description - Human Cleric:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Human Clerics</font> can perform holy miracles by the power of their faith. Heaven favors them.<br>
Their magic primarily focused on helping other players. By using holy magic, they heal and cast Buffs, which makes them essential for a group.<br>
After a Class Transfer they can't fight, except perhaps in a close combat. They can barely learn attacking spells. Clerics possess low attack power but compensate for it with various Buffs.<br>
