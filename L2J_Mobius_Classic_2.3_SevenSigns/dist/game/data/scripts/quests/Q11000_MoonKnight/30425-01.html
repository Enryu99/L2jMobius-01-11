I know what this is about. Show me the contract...<br>
This is a seal of Iron Scale Guild. There is only one Dwarf from this guild nearby - <font color="LEVEL">Trader Rolento</font>... But he would not sell armor to Turek Orcs. He is not a bad person...<br>
There is a misunderstanding! Or someone had set him up... Talk to him and clear him of all suspicion. Please! Rolento runs a store in the <font color="LEVEL">Southern Entrance to the Wasteland</font>. You have to meet him.
