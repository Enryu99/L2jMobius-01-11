You haven't finished all the tests. In order to overcome your limit, you must pass all the tests.<br>
You must overcome not just the limit of the power you were born with, but also the limit of the new power you obtained.<br>
Make sure your <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 104</font>. Then, go find <font color="LEVEL">Sporcha</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Refugee Village</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Captain Krenaht</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Giants Cave</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Santiago</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Arcturus</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Hunters Village</font>, and pass the tests they give you.<br>
It's best that you hear about the tests from them. Remember to bring back their certificates.
