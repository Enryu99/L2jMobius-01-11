Thank you! That's one load off my mind. May the blessing of Einhasad be with you.<br>
I've prepared a special item for you that's called <font color=LEVEL>Lantern</font>. Lanterns can be different colours, but I givetravelers only <font color=LEVEL>Blue Lanterns</font>. Try to <font color=LEVEL>use</font> it. Using this Lantern you can charge the <font color=LEVEL>Magic Lamp</font> bar. That will make you stronger.<br>
By the way, <font color=LEVEL>Sayha's Grace</font> disappears over time. It's very hard to get XP and adena without Sayha's Grace. so make sure you always have it.<br>
If you <font color=LEVEL>use</font> a <font color=LEVEL>Blue Lantern</font> that I'm going to give you, and reach <font color=LEVEL>Lv. 40</font>, you will get <font color=LEVEL>Sayha's Blessing</font> as a <font color=LEVEL>reward for completing the quest</font>. It will help you restore Sayha's Grace.
