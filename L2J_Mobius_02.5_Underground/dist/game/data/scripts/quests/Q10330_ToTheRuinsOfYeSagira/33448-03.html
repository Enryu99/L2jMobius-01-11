Well then, it is my duty to help you as much as I can.<br>
To get to the ruins, follow the path you came, only in the opposite direction. Walk until you meet <font color="LEVEL">Lakcis</font> - he stands at the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira Entrance</font> . <br1>
 He's a scholar, so can't go into Ruins of Ye Sagira. Go help him.
