It is these gates that do not allow us to find out what is happening inside the Headquarters of the Legion.<br>
Only Bershtein can open them, and while he is inside the headquarters, they cannot be opened from the outside. The only possibility is the moment when Bershtein enters the Legion Headquarters. But this happens almost instantly. It is necessary to somehow hold the gates so that they do not close immediately.<br>
