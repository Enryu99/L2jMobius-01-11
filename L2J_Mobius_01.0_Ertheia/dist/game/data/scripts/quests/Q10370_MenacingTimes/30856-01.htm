As you already know Shilen sent several of her creatures to destroy Aden Castle. With your help, you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop this attack. Now our soldiers can come home and focus on protecting Aden.<br>
Although this has been victory, news from Aden Vanguard has me concerned. As much as I would like attend to these matters personally, I have work here that must be complete. Do you think you can help me?<br>
