Good work. I'm impressed by the way you and your apprentice work together. You make a good team. I'm glad to be able to provide this growth opportunity to the both of you. There might be a chance for you to increase your enlightenment, while I'm working on this. Now, I'll need some time to make the ring.<br>
Ah, I need to talk to your apprentice about this. Could you please let your apprentice know?
