To tell the truth, I'm not exactly sure. It's something to do with <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. The fact that they have Suspicious Fragments proves it. So, it's highly likely that they also have something to do with the seal. If I study the Suspicious Fragments of Sel Mahum, I'll learn a lot more about the Seal of Punishment.<br>
If you have time, can you help me?<br>
