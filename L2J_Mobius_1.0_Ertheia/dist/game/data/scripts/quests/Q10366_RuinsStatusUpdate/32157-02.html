Marvelous! It's good to hear that the monster population is finally on the downturn. Such good news. I was worried, everyone over there has a grat scholarly pedigree, but no one had any good fightings skills or common sense! You know that scientist type. Brainy, but not terribly practical. This is a great weight off of my shoulders. Do you have any other news?<br>
